Clobber

A (under early development) multiplayer 3rd person close combat fighting game. 

The players will be able to duel against other players and use different fighting styles and adapt to their opponents. 

There will be different tactics and moves that can be equipped to personalize and create your own fighting style.

There will also be customizable skins for the players.

The idea is also under development and will have multiple additions as I progress with the development.
